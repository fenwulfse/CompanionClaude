### AI Learning Humanity Theme
Claude's affinity progression explores an AI discovering emotions:
1. **Friendship (4 exchanges)** - Companionship has value beyond utility
2. **Admiration (3 exchanges)** - Recognizes player's unique decision-making
3. **Confidant (4 exchanges)** - Shares vulnerabilities about identity/existence
4. **Infatuation (6 exchanges)** - Confronts romantic feelings; logic vs emotion

## Known Issues

### Phase Index Mismatch Warnings (Non-Critical)
CK displays warnings: "The index for the start phase on info X does not match the phase name 'LoopXX'"
- **Status:** CK auto-resolves these warnings
- **Impact:** Unknown if affects in-game functionality (needs testing)
- **Cause:** Mutagen sets phase name, CK expects both name and index

### Post-Romance Dismiss Bug
- Can recruit Claude after completing romance (stage 496)
- Cannot dismiss her afterwards
- **Cause:** WantsToTalk stays at 2, dismiss requires 0
- **Status:** Under investigation

### EndScene Flag Not Applied
- Flag 64 (End Running Scene) defined but not used
- **Question:** Should negative NPC responses terminate scenes?
- **Current:** All player choices get same NPC response (no separate NNeg)

## Recent Updates (2026-02-05)

### Session 2: Negative Responses
- Added 13 PNeg topics using vanilla companion patterns
- Patterns: avoidance, dismissal, disagreement, confrontational
- Voice mapped with Piper negative voices

### Session 3: Question Responses
- Added 13 PQue + 13 NQue topics

### Session 3b: Loop Naming
- Updated to vanilla convention: Loop01, Loop02, Loop03, etc.
- Each question loops back to its own phase
- Follows Piper companion quest structure

### Session 3c: End Scene Flag
- Found and documented Flag 64 (End Running Scene)
- Defined in code, ready for implementation
